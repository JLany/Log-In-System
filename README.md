# LogIn System

This is a basic login system that allows the user to register and display his/her personal information using a username and a password.

- This system allows the user to register (using an email, phone number, name, username, password), login (using a username and password), and change password (if he/she has registered previously).
- The passwords are stored encrypted.
- "UserData.txt" is the file where the data (username, name, email, password, and phone number) of the users is stored. 
- The program is divided into 3 files : 
  1) "CS112-203-2nd-S25-20210508-20210544-20210563-A4-LoginApp.cpp" is the main file
  2) "CS112-203-2nd-S25-20210508-20210544-20210563-A4-LoginFunctions.cpp" is the source code (functions' & classes' definitions..)
  3) "CS112-203-2nd-S25-20210508-20210544-20210563-A4-LoginFunctions.h" is the header file
